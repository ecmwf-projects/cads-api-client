CADS API Python client

Documentation: https://ecmwf-projects.github.io/cads-api-client/

The `ApiClient` requires the `url` to the API root and a valid API `key`. You can also set the `CADS_API_URL` and `CADS_API_KEY` environment variables, or use a configuration file. The configuration file must be located at `~/.cads-api-client.json`, or at the path specified by the `CADS_API_RC` environment variable.

```
$ cat $HOME/.cads-api-client.json
{"url": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api", "key": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"}
```

It is possible (though not recommended) to use the API key of one of the test users, `00112233-4455-6677-c899-aabbccddeeff`. This key is used for anonymous tests and is designed to be the least performant option for accessing the system.

## Quick Start

Configure the logging level to display INFO messages:

```python
>>> import logging
>>> logging.basicConfig(level="INFO")

```

Instantiate the API client and verify the authentication:

```python
>>> import os
>>> from cads_api_client import ApiClient
>>> client = ApiClient(
...     url=os.getenv("CADS_API_URL"),
...     key=os.getenv("CADS_API_KEY"),
... )
>>> client.check_authentication()
{...}

```

Explore a collection:

```python
>>> collection_id = "reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels"
>>> collection = client.get_collection(collection_id)
>>> collection.end_datetime
datetime.datetime(...)

>>> request = {
...     "product_type": "reanalysis",
...     "variable": "temperature",
...     "year": "2022",
...     "month": "01",
...     "day": "01",
...     "pressure_level": "1000",
...     "time": "00:00",
... }
>>> collection.process.apply_constraints(**request)
{...}

```

Retrieve data:

```python
>>> client.retrieve(collection_id, **request, target="tmp1-era5.grib")  # blocks
'tmp1-era5.grib'

>>> remote = client.submit(collection_id, **request)  # doesn't block
>>> remote.request_uid
'...'
>>> remote.status
'...'
>>> remote.download("tmp2-era5.grib")  # blocks
'tmp2-era5.grib'

```

Interact with a previously submitted job:

```python
>>> remote = client.get_remote(remote.request_uid)
>>> remote.delete()
{...}

```

## Workflow for developers/contributors

For best experience create a new conda environment (e.g. DEVELOP) with Python 3.11:

```
conda create -n DEVELOP -c conda-forge python=3.11
conda activate DEVELOP
```

Before pushing to GitHub, run the following commands:

1. Update conda environment: `make conda-env-update`
1. Install this package: `pip install -e .`
1. Sync with the latest [template](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/cookiecutter-conda-package) (optional): `make template-update`
1. Run quality assurance checks: `make qa`
1. Run tests: `make unit-tests`
1. Run the static type checker: `make type-check`
1. Build the documentation (see [Sphinx tutorial](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/)): `make docs-build`
